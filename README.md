# Shifty
*A simple app to manage my shifts at work.*
Shifty allows me to add, edit, and remove shifts and see a simple rundown of upcoming and recent workweeks.
It also shows the expected pay for a workweek, provides a calculator to work out the net pay for a number of worked hours or
a gross amount of pay. A search function is also provided to a shifts in a specific week or month. This is designed around a 
casual work schedule and allows me to keep track of my income at a glance.
